# Quick Start Guide

This is a guide to help you start writing your first content piece quickly. It will only cover the basics of authoring a single piece, please ensure you read the [FAQ](FAQ.md).

## Getting ready to write

The first step to start writing is to create a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) of this repo by clicking the `Fork` button at the top right of this page, and creating a copy in your personal GitHub account. Next, create a new [branch](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow#create-a-branch) in your repo with a descriptive name of what the content is about - don't spend too much time on picking a perfect one, it just needs to be close to the topic you are writing about.

Next, you need to be able to add your content by creating a new folder, files, and add any images you want to use. If you are familiar with doing this and working with Markdown, please skip to the [next section](#creating-your-content).

For those new to using Git and GitHub to manage files, we recommend using the built-in CodeSpaces feature of GitHub.
