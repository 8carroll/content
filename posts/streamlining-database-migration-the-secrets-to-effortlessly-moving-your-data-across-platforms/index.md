### Introduction
Data migration is a crucial process in today's technological world that most businesses undertake to keep their systems up-to-date. However, data migration can be complex and challenging, requiring meticulous planning and execution to prevent potential issues. One of the essential aspects of data migration is maintaining integrity, which involves creating database constraints and other necessary database objects. Additionally, using indexes correctly is crucial to avoid performance problems. 

Focusing solely on data migration without considering these critical factors can lead to severe issues, such as data inconsistencies and performance problems. Therefore, you should prioritize these aspects of data migration to avoid data inconsistencies and performance issues down the line. In this blog we will focus on such aspects for a Relational Database Migration.

### Constraints
Database constraints are rules that are enforced on the data stored within a database table to maintain its accuracy, consistency, and integrity. These constraints help ensure that the data conforms to specific criteria or conditions, such as uniqueness, data type, and relationship with other tables, and prevent the introduction of erroneous or invalid data.

Some common types of database constraints include:
* Primary key constraint: Ensures that each record in a table has a unique identifier, used to uniquely identify each record in a table
* Foreign key constraint: Defines a relationship between two tables, ensuring that the values in one table's column match the values in another table's column. This is also called referential integrity.
* Unique constraint: Ensures that the values in a particular column or set of columns are unique.
* Not null constraint: Ensures that a particular column cannot have a null value.
* Check constraint: Defines a condition that values in a column must meet to be considered valid.
* Default constraint: Specifies a default value for a column when a new record is inserted and the value for that column is not explicitly specified.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to add them. The process of checking and creating constraints can differ slightly among various database engines:

* Identify missing constraints: Review the database schema and data to identify any missing constraints or tables that need to be added.
* Add primary keys: To add a primary key, identify the column(s) that should be used as the primary key and then use the ALTER TABLE statement to add the PRIMARY KEY constraint.
* Add foreign key: create a new table that will be used as the reference table, then use the FOREIGN KEY constraint to link the reference table to the appropriate columns in the main table. Do ensure, all values in the referencing column of main table are present in referenced column of reference table.
* Add other constraints: There are several other constraints that should be added to ensure data accuracy and consistency, including UNIQUE constraints, CHECK constraints, DEFAULT constraint, and NOT NULL constraints. To add these constraints, use the appropriate ALTER TABLE statements.
* Test and validate: Once all the constraints have been added, it's essential to test and validate the database to ensure that all the data is correct and that the constraints are working correctly.

 
### Indexes
A database index is a powerful tool that can dramatically improve the performance of data retrieval operations on a database table by quickly locating specific data based on the values in one or more columns. By creating and selecting indexes carefully, you can make your database queries more efficient and responsive. 

For example, if you have a table with 1 million rows and you create an index on the column you're querying, the same query that took several seconds without an index could take only a fraction of a second with an index.

| Condition             | Performance                                           |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Without an index      | Slow, especially on large tables as database scans the entire table to find matches |
| With an index         | Faster, the database can use that index to quickly find the rows that match your query       |


    
Did you know that a primary key is a special type of index in a database? It uniquely identifies each row in a table and helps the database quickly find the right piece of information you're looking for based on that identifier.
After a data migration, it is important to ensure that primary keys (PKs) and indexes are added to maintain performance. To analyze the new database for usage patterns to add indexes, you can follow these steps:

* Identify the most frequently accessed tables in the new database. This can be done by reviewing database logs or monitoring user activity.
* Identify the most frequently executed queries against these tables.
* Review the indexes that were present in the original database and compare them to the queries that are being executed in the new database. If there are any queries that are not being optimized by the current indexes, consider adding additional indexes to improve performance.
* Keep in mind that adding too many indexes can also negatively impact performance, so it is important to strike a balance between having enough indexes to optimize queries and not having too many indexes that can slow down the database. This is because, index management is also an overhead for database engines.
* After adding new indexes, it is important to monitor the database's performance to ensure that the changes are having the desired effect. If performance is not improving, consider revising the index strategy or consulting with a database expert to identify other potential performance issues. If the database is hosted as a managed service on AWS, you can also reach out to AWS Premium Support for assistance.



### DMS Schema Conversion
Database objects such as indexes and constraints are a few examples of structures that store and organize data in a database. There are various other database objects like views, stored procedures and triggers that may also need to be migrated. It can be challenging to manually analyze and migrate all of these database objects. To simplify the process, AWS DMS Schema Conversion can be used. DMS Schema Conversion automates the conversion of database schemas and code objects to a format compatible with the target database, allowing for easier and more efficient migration. This flexibility enables not only homogeneous migrations but also heterogeneous migrations.

To convert your database schema using AWS DMS Schema Conversion, the following steps can be taken:
1. Setting up transformation rules: Before converting your database, it's essential to set up transformation rules that will change the names of your database objects during conversion. This will ensure that the converted objects are named correctly and consistently in the target database.
2. Creating a migration assessment report: To estimate the complexity of the migration, create a migration assessment report. This report provides crucial details about the schema elements that DMS Schema Conversion can't convert automatically. This information is valuable in planning for any necessary manual conversions.
3. Converting your source database objects: Using DMS Schema Conversion, convert your source database objects. The tool will create a local version of the converted database objects, which you can access in your migration project.
4. Saving converted code to SQL files: After conversion, save the converted code to SQL files. This allows you to review, edit, or address any conversion action items that need to be taken. Alternatively, you can apply the converted code directly to your target database.

As you may understand, using AWS DMS Schema Conversion can help in reducing the manual efforts required for creating necessary database objects like indexes, constraints, functions, views, and more. This is achieved through the automation of the creation process, which in turn saves valuable time and resources that can be better used for more critical tasks during the migration process.

### Summary:
Database Migration can be a complex process, and one of the important things to keep in mind is the integrity and performance of the data.
To maintain the integrity of the data, we use constraints, which are like rules that help ensure the data is accurate and consistent. There are different types of constraints, like PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL, CHECK, and DEFAULT constraints.
We can also use indexes to improve the performance of data retrieval operations on a database table. A primary key is actually a special type of index that helps the database quickly find the right information you're looking for based on a unique identifier.
After migration, it's important to check if all the constraints and indexes are in place to maintain performance. We can also analyze the new database for usage patterns to add more indexes if needed. But we should be careful not to add too many indexes as it can negatively impact performance.
