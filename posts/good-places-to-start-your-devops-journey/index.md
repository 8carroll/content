# Good Places to Start Your DevOps Journey
The IT industry is always evolving and it offers a variety of opportunities. One job title in particular has received a lot of attention in the past few years, and that's DevOps Engineer.

Until 5 years ago I knew nothing about DevOps. I do have a technical background, but until 2018 my job was to plan and design microwave transmission networks. That changed while I was working for one of my previous companies. The project I was working on has come to an end and I had to find a new position at the same company. Among other roles I've discovered the DevOps Engineer one, and it was the most attractive one. I had a talk with the manager and I was told to learn a bit of programming, scripting and a bit about databases and then to have a technical interview. I passed the interview and I became a DevOps Engineer. This is how my IT career started.

" *DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes.* " This is one definition from [AWS page](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/) I find it brings everything together. DevOps is about people, processes, and the best way they can be brought up together to accelerate the pace of innovation. 
You may see different job titles related to practical implementation of DevOps like: Platform Engineer, Site Reliability Engineer and so on. There are multiple resources online to compare them, so I'm not going to do that here. 

# Planning your career journey
A career was usually planned before going to college and the decision was an important one because you couldn't easly change it afterwards. Nowadays career changes and career conversions are possible, and I think this brings another component of diversity in IT. People who come from different career backgrounds, can bring their unique perspective in. Whatever the reason, if you think about trying DevOps, read on.

After getting my hands on as a DevOps engineer, I discovered more and more things that I could try and that I could learn. I discovered this thing called `cloud` and I started working with Amazon Web Services console. I later on discovered this new thing `Infrastructure as Code`, and I really wanted to try it. Discovering new things was overwhelming but that gave me the opportunity to chose. At this point I was learning for my first AWS certification and looking for a job that will allow me to develop further and to do IaC hands on. It may sound silly but I even moved to another country to achieve this goal (kidding, but not 100%). 

It's good to have options and choosing the one you want to go for next is easier now. I learned there are two types of decisions: 1 way door decision and 2 way door decision. What that means is that there are things that you choose, decisions that you make that can't be undone, but there are also reversibile decisions, meaning if you don't like it, you can change your mind and go back.

DevOps is not an entry level job in the industry, due to the broad range of tasks you will be resoponsible for, but this doesn't mean you can't do it. Some of the DevOps responsabilities include:
 - build and set up new development tools and infrastructure
 - automate and improve development and release processes
 - test and examine code written by others and analyse the results
 - ensureg that systems are safe and secure against cybersecurity threats
 - identify technical problems and develop software updates and ‘fixes’
 - work with software developers and software engineers to ensure that development follows established processes and works as intended

### Tip: Don't be afraid to try things out. 


# Get involved
While living in The Netherlands I discovered Meetup and communities like AWS User Groups and ServerlesDays Amsterdam. At first, attending the events wasn't easy for me. Although I like to talk to people, I am not an extrovert, and I was outside my comfort zone. Seeing how welcoming the communities are and how open minded everybody is, made me come back again and again, until I even volunteered for one of the meetups and it was the best experience. And I didn't stop here. I found out about the [AWS Community Builders](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/community-builders/) program and this one has drawn my attention. This program is for passionate people who contribute to the community in any way and on any technical topics, not only AWS. Being part of this community gave me the chance to be connected with great people who really inspire me, and led me to attend re:Invent in person where I met builders from all around the world, people who are passionate about DevOps, Serverless, Security and everything else. These are the people to talk to and ask advices and opinions about DevOps and any other roles.

The best way to approach any career change is to **be involved in the community**. **Go to events**, do this extra level of effort, it's well worth it. You can meet people who already have the position you are looking to try out and **ask how it is**, you can see what is the vibe and if you would like to be part of this community or if this position is something that you really want to do. **Volunteer** to help out, it is not that difficult. Some of the meetups are asking for volunteers at the events, and you can always ask first what it will be like to be a volunteer, what will you have to do, and how much time you will have to spend each week or month. 

Attending events is a good entry point to meet people with the same interests at, but you can also follow them on LinkedIn or your favourite platform. It's good to be in touch. And while you have to do your own research about the new position, you can then reach out to people. They are more than happy to help 

### Tip: Do your own research, and then talk to other people.

# Conclusion
When you want to start your DevOps journey you can have a look at the [DevOps Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/devops), and then talk to people already in the job about it. A roadmap offers a very good overview, but the insights you get from the experienced people are priceless, and more relevant in my opinion. Because as a DevOps you will end up working with a lot of different techinologies, it's both a good thing and a bad thing: a good thing because it's ok to not know about a specific technology - you will learn it, a bad thing because it can be overwhelming to constantly adapt to changes. 

From the community I recommend you watch the [Getting started with DevOps w/ Lian Li](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpglhplg-to) from **Women in Cloud Native**.

You can learn more about DevOps and other career paths in IT, what they mean and what you need to know to do the job, by watching this great [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmWkcePhf84&t=1486s) by Nana Janashia.

As I mentioned, now more than ever it's a time when you can easily change your career path, and Forbes explains [Why Non-Linear Career Paths Are The Future](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinecastrillon/2023/02/26/why-non-linear-career-paths-are-the-future/?sh=74f7d2da13a9). This is a good article to read for any change you want to do in your career now.
