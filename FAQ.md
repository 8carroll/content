## Markdown Syntax

### Where do I find the general Markdown syntax guide?

ðŸ‘‰ https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/

### I have a series of posts. How do I link them together?

Currently, there is no built-in support for a series of posts, however you can accomplish this using simple [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). Example:

```
This is a 3-part series:
1. What is broken access control? (this post)
1. [What is a cryptographic failure?](/posts/owasp-top-10-defined/02-what-is-a-cryptographic-failure/)
1. [What is an injection attack?](/posts/owasp-top-10-defined/03-what-is-an-injection-attack/)
```

_Note: Add a trailing slash at the end._

You can then structure the layout of your files like this:

```
posts
â”œâ”€â”€ owasp-top-10-defined
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 01-what-is-broken-access-control
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.md
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ broken-access-control.png
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 02-what-is-a-cryptographic-failure
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.md
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cryptographic-failure.png
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 03-what-is-an-injection-attack
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.md
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ what-is-an-injection-attack.png
```

Where `posts/owasp-top-10-defined/01-what-is-broken-access-control/index.md` is part 1, `posts/owasp-top-10-defined/02-what-is-a-cryptographic-failure/index.md` is part 2, and `posts/owasp-top-10-defined/03-what-is-an-injection-attack/index.md` is part 3.

The resulting URL mapping will be:
- https://buildon.aws/posts/owasp-top-10-defined/01-what-is-broken-access-control/
- https://buildon.aws/posts/owasp-top-10-defined/02-what-is-a-cryptographic-failure/
- https://buildon.aws/posts/owasp-top-10-defined/03-what-is-an-injection-attack/

You can see an example of this in the repo [here](/posts/owasp-top-10-defined).

### How do I link to other posts in my series or other posts on the BuildOn.AWS site?

You can reference them using absolute paths like this, but **omit the `.md`** as we turn the markdown into an HTML document:

- `[What is a cryptographic failure?](/posts/owasp-top-10-defined/02-what-is-a-cryptographic-failure/)`
- `[A cool tutorial](/tutorials/a-cool-tutorial/)`

_Note: Please do not hard code the full URL in the post_

### How do I show images in my post?

Store your images (jpg, png, webp, svg, gif) in an `images` subdirectory of your post.

```
posts
â”œâ”€â”€ what-happens-when-you-type-a-url-in-your-browser
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ the-internet.jpg
```

_Note: Do not share images across posts or even posts in a series._

To show images in your post, you'll link to them using a relative path:

`![Put your alt-text here](images/the-internet.jpg) "Put your image title/caption here"`

The caption will appear underneath the image and also on mouse over.

### How do I show videos in my post?

At the moment, only YouTube videos are supported. Simply place the URL of the video in a separate line, for example:

```
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor.
```

It works with the domains youtube.com, youtu.be or youtube-nocookie.com.

### How do I get syntax highlighting in my code snippets?

Use standard markdown code blocks, and specify the language, for example:

````markdown
   ```java
   System.out.println("Hello World!");
   ```
````

If you do not specify a language, we still try to guess the most adequate. But this detection is not perfect, and you will get consistent output if you explicitly indicate the language. If you want to disable syntax highlighting guessing in a code snippet, simply specify "text" or "plaintext" language. This is particularly useful for embedding the output of running commands, for example.

### What languages does syntax highlighting support?

Currently, the following languages are supported:

* bash (or sh)
* clojure
* cpp (or c++)
* csharp (or c#)
* css
* dockerfile (or docker)
* fsharp (or f#)
* go
* java
* javascript
* json
* kotlin
* php
* plaintext
* powershell
* python
* ruby
* shell
* swift
* typescript
* xml
* yaml (or yml)
* html
* sh
* text (or plaintext). This one actually disables highlighting preventing incorrect guessing.

### How do I write the same code snippet in different languages?

If you want embed the same code snippet in different languages, for example, explaining how to do some algorithm in Java, Python, Javascript, etc., put them in a list. The list must contain in all its elements a small piece of text (the title) and a code snippet, for example:

````markdown 
* Javascript
    ```javascript
    console.log("Hello world");
    ```
* Java
    ```java
    System.out.println("Hello world");
    ```
* Python
    ```python
    print("Hello world")
    ```
* Linux bash
    ```sh
    echo "Hello world"
    ```
````

This will be rendered as one single code block with different tabs on the top for the different code snippets. The title of each tab will be the text in every list item. Notice that if any of the list elements does not respect this format, the whole list will be rendered as a normal list.


## Miscellaneous

### I published my post on my personal blog/Dev.to/Medium. Can I publish it on BuildOn.AWS?

Please donâ€™t syndicate to other platforms right now as we donâ€™t want to drive traffic back to BuildOn.AWS during the soft launch. The canonical link helps surface the original content in search results.

### Why was my content proposal not accepted? Do you have feedback for me?

We will add feedback to your content proposal issue if we have suggestions for improvements. In many cases, the content is not a good fit for this platform and that is why it was not accepted.

### How do I optimize my content for SEO?
