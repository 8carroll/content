# Frequently Asked Questions

### I have a series of posts. How do I link them together?

Currently, there is no built-in support for series, however you can accomplish this using simple [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). Example:

```
This is a 3-part series:
1. [Title of part 1]()
1. [Title of part 2]()
1. [Title of part 3]()
```
